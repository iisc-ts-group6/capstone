            "page_content=\"Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to make their own food. In this process, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata. They also absorb water (H₂O) from the soil through their roots. Using energy from sunlight, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of sugar, and oxygen (O₂). The glucose provides energy and building materials for the plant, while the oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide is a gas that is naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere. It consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms (CO₂). It is essential for photosynthesis because it provides the carbon that plants need to make glucose.\\n\\ntypically Photosynthesis requires sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to occur.\\n\\nOn the other hand, carbon monoxide (CO) is a different gas that consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. Unlike carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide is poisonous. It can bind to hemoglobin in our blood more effectively than oxygen, preventing oxygen from being transported to cells and tissues. This can be very dangerous for humans and animals.\\n\\nThe main difference between carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide is their chemical composition and effects on living organisms. Carbon dioxide is non-toxic and necessary for plants to perform photosynthesis, while carbon monoxide is toxic and harmful if inhaled in large amounts.\\n\\nIn summary, photosynthesis is vital for plants and life on Earth as it produces oxygen and food. Carbon dioxide is crucial for this process, whereas carbon monoxide is harmful and should be avoided.\" metadata={'source': '/content/Grade_8.txt'}\n"
